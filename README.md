### How to run the project
You need to have Node.js installed to run the application.
#### Using the .bat Script (for Windows Only)
1. First of all, to visualize the application, you will need a mobile device emulator with Android 13 "Tiramisu" running on it.
2. Then, you have to download the zip file that contains the source code and extract it to a directory, or you can simply clone this repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PepeTonin/projeto-compass_sales-pedro-henrique-de-avila-tonin-squad07.git
```

3. **With the emulator open**, just run the file "autoRun.bat" to execute the scripts.
